Then enter: make

This will create restart, restart.o, hello.o, hello, libckpt.so and run the hello program.
Now, as given in the makefile, the hello program would be interrupted by SIGUSR2 and myckpt - checkpoint image would be created.
The program would be killed later.

To resume the program from the checkpoint, run command
